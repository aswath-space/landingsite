# Hi! I'm Aswath - The enginee-writer in search of the big picture.
He who fights global warming one rooftop an hour, and may or may not be a writer in secret. I am excited that you are here, and I would love for you to journey with me into a universe where a bit of everything intersects with a bit of everything else - Science, spirituality, society, sustainability... 

## Why so many things, you may ask?
Well, it is because I believe we, although individuals in a microcosm, are still a part of a larger construct, and there is a certain pattern. We get to see this when we break down, or combine, several aspects of lives over different scales of time. I find that such deconstruction, and cumulation, aids me both as an engineer, to identify opportunities and solve problems in lines of what my customer expects. But also as a writer, the human on a treasure hunt to make sense of several things. Both within himself, and the rest of the universe.

# My small journey - Vellore to World.
Your friendly global enginee-writer comes from the city (then a small town) of Vellore, where I spent a childhood with enough power outages that motivated me to dislike the idea of centralized power supply. When I went to my bachelors, renewable energy was the natural call. After a slight detour into the industrial world of paper packaging, I came back to the original mission with renewed purpose, finished my masters in Sustainability @TU Delft, working in the solar industry right now. 

That is of course, the engineer. The writer's journey was far more turbulent. There was this one child, short-tempered, confused, feeling out of place. Somewhere down the line, he became a teen who broke out of the small talk and superficial issues, and started to wonder, *what makes him do this?*. That was my beginning as a seeker, asking that one extra question, trying to get one level deeper. During my bachelor's, I tried my hand at [blogging](https://thepeepaltreeblog.wordpress.com/). This experience helped me see the pleasures of writing my thoughts into words. This helped me understand myself much better, and also challenged my limit, which I am now breaking.

# The Conversations I am passionate about.
Here's an example of a typical conversation I love to have: We start by talking about science, jump into the motivations for what makes our minds innovate, try to apply the dimension of emotionality, and how this fits into the overall society. We segue into how the progression of society is underpinned by spirituality, how our inner selves guide our emotions and morality, and how this template drives discipline. Finally, we discuss how all of this culminates into improvement, AKA innovation.

Sounds like something for a few hours, right?

Here's one more: We look through a nice research paper, or a few news articles that talk about "Future of Energy" and argue (very diplomatically, of course) the economies of scale of adaptation of new energy technologies, the ways of making it happen, and the limitations, prerequisites - Your typical Thursday talk.

Think about it, every time you start this conversation, you ALWAYS end up learning something more than you did before. And that is what I love, at the end - Incrementally getting better. 

Of course, that is not to say that I would only want super-serious conversations every single time. Sometimes, I equally find pleasure (guiltily so) in just *talking*. No grand purpose, just two or three people exchanging just about anything.

Also, *psst*, if you want to share your good feelings about Webtoons and manga, you know where to find me.

# The things I do in free time.
Outside of what I already mentioned above, you can also find me writing, or waving my legs in the air as I train my taekwondo, or any other skill I might pick up in future. Slightly less common, I also try to come up with single-pot recipes for lazy cooking. If I am not doing any of the above, you can bet your four mugs of coffee I am not watching anime. Then lose that bet and send it my way.
