# Hi! I'm Aswath - The enginee-writer in search of the big picture.
He who fights global warming one rooftop an hour, and may or may not be a writer in secret. I am excited that you are here, and I would love for you to journey with me into a universe where a bit of everything intersects with a bit of everything else - Science, spirituality, society, sustainability... 

## Why so many things, you may ask?
Well, it is because I believe we, although individuals, are still a part of a larger construct, and there is a certain pattern when we break down, or combine, several aspects of lives over different scales of time.

# My small journey - Vellore to World.
